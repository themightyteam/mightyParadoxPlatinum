# mightyParadoxPlatinum

Mighty Paradox returns with "Mighty Paradox Platinum"! (If you like it, we can make the previous ones :)

Follow us on http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=36344

Playable versions for web (http://punkto.github.io/LD34/web/index.html) and desktop (java jar at http://punkto.github.io/LD34/desktop/mightyParadoxPlatinum-1.0.jar).

You are a cursed monk that has to reach the door at the end of the maze. This door starts closed, so you have to push TWO BUTTONS (controls, you know) that are somewhere in the maze.

Nothing is easy in this maze. A cruel uber-mage that can manipulate time and space puts new enemies in the maze and makes your monk (ninja monk, can you see how he moves?) repeat it, step by step. Your last opportunity is to go back in time as well and help your monk from the past (from the future? We don't really know). Of course, when you are tinkering with time things happen. If you touch your other monk you achieve a paradox, losing your battle with the uber-mage.

Of course, the uber-mage knows what you are doing and makes you repeat over and over (uber and uber), so the population of monks is GROWING each round (you only control the last monk that appears, the other repeat your movements as you did it). Each round you start a little earlier in time, so you can see where you appear and how can help your previous monks and, after that, go through the door.


Controls: Cursors as usual.


This game has been written by a team composed of:

- hmightypirate: creative, some code and (part of the)idea.
- punkto: code, some creative, and (the other part of the) idea.

We have used LIBGDX, as in our past games.
